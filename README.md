# The Log

A simple Electron app for taking notes and tracking tasks.

## To do

- [x] Persist to local storage
  - [ ] Export/import data
- [x] Auto-scroll, stick to the bottom
- [x] Display tasks in Tasks section
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts, e.g. to complete an item
  - [ ] Add new items using keyboard-shortcut, not "Enter"
- [ ] Responsive for small windows
- [x] Add support for tags
- [ ] Filter by tags
- [ ] Add date stamps
- [ ] Add app icon
  - This obviously needs to be some cheesy mix between a wooden log and a paper log. The cheesier the better.
- [ ] Include Fira Code font
- [ ] Slack-like inline Markdown formatting (bold, italic, code etc)
- [ ] Fix up/down arrow navigation
- [ ] Make `done` items a different colour
- [ ] Hide scrollbar after a few seconds
- [ ] Fix issue with dates not updating until reload
  - This is likely due to the update to `logs` is not being fed back down into the editor
  - Also causes inability to mark items as `done` until reload
